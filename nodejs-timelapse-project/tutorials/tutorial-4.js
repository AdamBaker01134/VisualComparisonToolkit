Now you can picture yourself as a climate change researcher.
For this task, you will be looking for trends in arctic sea ice over the last 40 years.
Daily satellite images of the north pole have been taken biannually to aid you in your research.
These images have been compiled into time-lapsed videos that have been pre-loaded within the comparison toolkit.
The videos span 1982-2022.
</p>

<p>
The videos have been placed in a grid layout with small dimensions to allow you to view everything at once.
This is meant to aid in comparison by reducing the strain on the user’s memory.
Play through all videos at the same time, and as they play, move your eyes from video to video.
</p>
<p>
Notice that it is easier to find differences now that the space between videos has been reduced.
Also, the consistent backgrounds in these videos improve the technique by reducing the details that need to be tracked by the observer’s eye.
</p>
<p>
Play through the videos multiple times and see if you can spot any trends occurring.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Does the shape/size of the sea ice change over the years?
</li>
<li>
Does the density of the ice change (white is high density, blue is low density)?
</li>
<li>
What might this mean?
</li>
<li>
Are there any specific areas that were dense with ice in the 80s (first 4 videos) that are not as dense in 2022 (the last video)?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last question is more specific and may be harder to answer because your eye must move a farther distance.
Another technique can now be utilized to help with this.
This technique is called shadow markers, and it allows you to place a mark in a video that will appear in all other videos, too.
</p>
<p>
Press the period key.
This will turn on shadow marking mode, highlighting your canvas in yellow and changing your cursor.
Now, find an area in one of the earlier videos that you’d like to track.
Click on that location, and a marker will show up in the video and all other videos, too.
Press the period key again to exit shadow marking mode.
</p>

<p>
Play through each video again and check if the ice density in the area you chose changes over the years.
The shadow marker acts as a focal point to draw your eye to your desired area of focus on each video.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the density of your chosen location change over the years?</li>
<li>Did the shadow marker help you come to this conclusion?</li>
<li>What could be done to improve the shadow marking technique?</li>
<li>Did you find it easier to compare multiple images that were smaller and more similar? Why or why not?</li>
</ul>
