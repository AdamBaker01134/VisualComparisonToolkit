Now picture yourself as a climate change researcher.
Your task will be to look for trends in arctic sea ice over the last 40 years.
</p>
<p>
Daily satellite images of the north pole have been taken biannually.
These images have been compiled into time-lapsed videos that have been pre-loaded within the comparison toolkit.
</p>
<img src="./tutorials/img/tutorial-task-4-1.png" />
<p>
The videos have been scaled down to allow you to view everything at once.
This is meant to reduce the strain on your memory as you look around the screen.
Play through all videos at the same time, and as they play, move your eyes from video to video.
</p>
<strong class="small-centered">Answer the following questions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do you notice any trends occurring over the years (i.e. ice size/density (colour) variation, etc.)?</li>
<li>Can you find somewhere on the map that changed the most in 30 years?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Another technique can now be used to answer the last question.
This technique is called shadow markers, and it allows you to place marks in a video that will appear in all other videos, too.
</p>
<p>
Press the period key to turn on shadow marking mode.
Find an area in one of the earlier videos that youâ€™d like to track.
Click on that location, and a marker will show up in the video and all other videos, too.
You can add multiple shadow markers if you wish.
To clear all your markers, press Delete.
</p>

<p>
Once you are happy with your markers, press the period key again to exit shadow marking mode.
</p>
<p>
Play through each video again.
The shadow marker acts as a focal point to draw your eye to your desired area of focus as you move from video to video. 
</p>
<strong class="small-centered">Answer the following questions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Did shadow markers help focus your attention on specific points within the video?</li>
<li>Would you prefer to compare these videos at a larger scale?</li>
</ul>
