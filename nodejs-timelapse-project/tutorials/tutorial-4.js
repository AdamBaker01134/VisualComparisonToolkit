Now you can picture yourself as a climate change researcher.
For this task, you will be looking for trends in the depletion of arctic sea ice over the last 40 years.
Daily satellite images of the north pole have been taken biannually to aid you in your research.
These images have been compiled into time-lapsed videos that have been pre-loaded within the comparison toolkit.
The videos span 1982-2022.
</p>

<p>
The videos have been placed in a grid layout with small dimensions to allow you to view everything at once.
This is meant to aid in comparison by reducing the strain on the user’s memory.
To better explain this concept, let’s test it out on the arctic ice videos.
</p>
<p>
Play through all videos at the same time, and as they play, move your eyes from video to video.
Notice that it is easier find differences now that the space between videos has been reduced.
Also, the stable backgrounds in these videos improve the technique by reducing the details that need to be tracked by the observer’s eye.
</p>
<p>
Play through the videos multiple times and see if you can spot any trends occurring.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Does the shape/size of the sea ice change over the years?
</li>
<li>
Does the density of the ice change (white is high density, blue is low density)?
</li>
<li>
Are there any specific areas that were dense with ice in the 80s that are not as dense now?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last question is more specific and may be harder to answer since finding detail in small videos can be difficult.
An additional technique can now be utilized to support your comparison.
This technique is called shadow markers.
It allows you to place a static marker anywhere within a video, and this marker will show up in all other displays.
The marker can be used to center your focus on specific areas you with to compare in every video.
</p>
<p>
Press the period key.
This will turn on shadow marking mode, highlighting your canvas in yellow and changing your cursor.
Now, find an area in one of the earlier videos that you’d like to track across all the videos.
Click on that location, and a marker will show up in the video and all other videos, too.
Press the period key again to exit shadow marking mode.
</p>

<p>
Play through each video again and check if the ice density in the area you chose changes over the years.
The shadow marker acts as a focal point to draw your eye to your desired area of focus on each video.
This was designed to hasten the search for specific areas in each video.
Now you can try placing the shadow marker somewhere else.
Repeat this process as many times as you wish.

Once you are satisfied with your analysis, you can leave this page.
