<h1>Tutorial 2 - Crop Flowering Cycles</h1>
<p>
You are now a crop researcher.
Youâ€™ve collected images of two separate crops flowering over the course of a month.
Your task is to compare the part of each video where the crops are flowering.
</p>
<p>
The two videos have been pre-loaded, and include timestamps to help you.
</p>
<img src="./tutorials/img/tutorial-task-2-1.png" />
Scrub the global timeline to play all the videos.
Compare the flowering cycles of each crop.
</p>
<p>
Now, "trim" each video to only include the parts where the crop is flowering.
To do this, scrub through each video and find when the crops begin to flower.
Then, right click on the white marker on the left side of the green timeline.
This will set the start of the video to your current position.

<p>
Now look for the point where the crop stops flowering (stops growing).
Trim the end of the video to this position by right clicking the white marker on the right.
</p>
<img src="./tutorials/img/tutorial-task-2-4.png" />
<p>
Scrub through all the videos and compare the full flowering cycles.
Pay attention to the timestamps.
</p>
<strong class="small-centered">Answer the following questions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Which crop flowered first?</li>
<li>Which crop stopped flowering first?</li>
</ul>
<p>
You may notice that even though the lengths of each video are different, each video plays start to finish in the same amount of time.
This is a technique called normalization.
If you want to play through each video without normalization, simply toggle the normalize checkbox in the middle of the webpage header.

<strong class="small-centered">Answer the following questions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Did trimming the videos help you to compare the flowering cycles? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Do you know what normalization refers to? Can you see this happening within the system?</li>
</ul>
