<h1>Tutorial 1 - Plant Growth</h1>
<p>
Picture yourself as a plant breeder researching the vegetative growth of the Arabidopsis Thaliana plant.
You’ve recorded time-lapsed video of 12 separate plants throughout their growth period which you’d like to compare.
</p>
<p>
The 12 videos have been pre-loaded into the system. By default, the videos are placed in a grid with static dimensions.
Unless you have a huge monitor, chances are that not all the videos are in full display.
To fix this, toggle the “Dynamic” option under Workspace Layout in the middle of the webpage header.
</p>

<p>
Now, hover over the bottom right corner of a video and click & drag to resize a single video.
Or to save time, hold control while you drag to resize all displays. Once you’ve found a preferable size, we can continue.
</p>

<strong style="text-align: center; font-size: small;">Note: Does not have to look like the above image.
The resize technique is meant to allow you customize your layout to whatever you prefer.</strong> 
<p>
There are two methods to playing through a video. The first is the manual method that we call "scrubbing”.
Under each video there are green timelines. Clicking and dragging on this timeline will play through the video.
The second method is a simple play feature. Select a display by clicking on it (this will highlight it in green) and press spacebar.
The video will auto-play until the end, at which point you can reset the position and continue playing.
</p>

<p>
Videos can be played individually or all at once using the global timeline at the bottom of the screen.
Scrubbing works the same for the global timeline, and you can activate its auto-play feature by unselecting any selected videos (by clicking on them) and pressing spacebar.
</p>
<p>
Now you can begin a comparative analysis of each of the videos.
Play through the videos at your leisure and note the similarities/differences you notice as your eye moves from video to video.
<ul>
<li>When are they the same?</li>
<li>How long are they the same?</li>
<li>When do they begin to look different?</li>
<li>How are they different?</li>
<li>Are there events that occur in some videos that don’t occur in others?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If you find it helpful, there is also a feature that allows you to move displays around. Click and drag a video you want to move and hover it over the target position for 2 seconds until the two displays switch positions. If you release early, an overlay will be created. This will be covered in tutorial 3.

<p>
You can zoom in on videos by scrolling while hovering over the video, and you can pan a video by clicking and dragging a video using the middle mouse button. These utility techniques are in place to aid in your comparison.
</p>
<p>
Once you are satisfied with your analysis, you can leave this page.
