<h1>Tutorial 1 - Plant Growth</h1>
<p>
Imagine that you are a plant breeder researching the vegetative growth of the Arabidopsis Thaliana plant.
You're task is to compare six separate plants and identify any similarities or differences.
</p>
<p>
Six plant videos have been pre-loaded into the system.
By default, the videos are placed in a grid with static dimensions.
</p>

<p>
You can resize the videos to fit within your screen.
To do this, first click on "Dynamic" under Workspace Layout at the top of the page.
Then, click & drag the bottom right corner of a video.
To resize all the videos, hold control while you drag.
</p>
<p>
Play through a video by selecting it (clicking it) and pressing spacebar.
Speed options are found at the top of the page.
</p>
<p>
Scrub through a video by clicking and dragging places within the green bar below the video.
</p>

<p>
The "global timeline" at the bottom of the screen controls all the videos.
Play or scrub through the videos, and press 'r' if you want to reset them all.
</p>
<strong class="small-centered">Answer the following questions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>What similarities do you see between the plants?</li>
<li>What differences do you see?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Try ranking the plants from best to worst by moving the videos around.
To move a video, click & drag overtop another video, wait a couple seconds, then release.
Releasing too early will create an overlay.

<p>
Zoom in on the smaller plants by holding the alt key and scrolling over a video.
Then, hold alt again and click and drag the video to adjust its position (pan the video).
</p>
<strong class="small-centered">Answer the following questions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Did you prefer scrubbing through individual videos, or all the videos at once?</li>
<li>Did moving, zooming, and panning the videos make them easier to compare?</li>
</ul>
