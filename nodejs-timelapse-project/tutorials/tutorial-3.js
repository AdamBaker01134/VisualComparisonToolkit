<h1>Tutorial 3 - Pitch Tunneling & Break</h1>
<p>
You’re an MLB (major league baseball) analyst that has been recruited to analyze pitch tunneling and compare the break in pitches thrown by different players.
Pitch tunneling is the idea that if the trajectory of two different pitches remains the same for long enough, then it will be harder for the batter to realize what the pitch type is.
Break in a pitch refers to the amount of horizontal/vertical movement the ball exhibits along its flight path.
Your task is to compare two separate pitchers and determine who has better pitch tunneling skill, and who has a larger break in their pitch.

<p>
Two pairs of videos have been pre-loaded into the toolkit.
The top two videos are Daniel Hudson’s pitches.
The bottom two videos are Lance Lynn’s pitches.
Resize the videos as you see fit.

<p>
We will be overlaying the two videos, but first we need to line them up.
We can do this automatically using a technique called coincident points.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the comma key to enter coincident pointing mode (this will highlight the canvas in blue and change your cursor to a pointer).
</li>
<li>
On the first Daniel Hudson video (top left), click to place two points somewhere in the video that also appears in the second video (for simplicity, one on Daniel’s glove and one on the back of Daniel’s shoe).
</li>
<li>
Place two more points on the second video, in the same order you placed them in the first video (i.e., glove, then shoe).
</li>
<li>
Once the fourth point is placed, the first video will snap to the same position as the second video.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Repeat this process with the Lance Lynn videos. Now both videos should be lined up and ready to be overlayed.
Exit coincident pointing mode by pressing the comma key again.
</p>
<p>
Start by dragging the second Lance Lynn video on top of the first to create an overlay.
Repeat this process with the two Daniel Hudson videos.
Your layout may look messy now, so you can delete the original displays by selecting them and pressing Delete.
Then, position the two overlays side-by-side like this:

<p>
Overlays are extremely powerful comparison tools.
They allow the observer to view two or more videos within the same space using a transparent filter.
Each overlay comes with three timelines: one for each independent video, and the third which controls both.
You also can pan like in tutorial 1 to further line up the two videos (click and drag with middle mouse button).
Try manipulating each overlay so that they are synched.
Once you are happy with how they look, play through each overlay independently.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Do you see pitch tunneling occurring and/or break in the ball?
</li>
<li>
Who has a more consistent flight path?
</li>
<li>
Who has a larger break in their pitch?
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once you are satisfied with your analysis, you can leave this page.
