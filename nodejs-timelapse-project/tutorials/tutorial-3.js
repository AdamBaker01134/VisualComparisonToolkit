<h1>Tutorial 3 - Pitch Tunneling & Break</h1>
<p>
You are an MLB analyst that has been recruited to analyze baseball pitchers.
Data has been collected for pitchers Daniel Hudson and Lance Lynn.
Your task is to identify who has a more consistent pitch and who's pitch breaks the hardest.
</p>
<p>
Two pairs of videos have been pre-loaded into the toolkit.
The first two videos are Daniel Hudson’s pitches.
The last two videos are Lance Lynn’s pitches.
</p>

<strong class="small-centered">Please make sure your videos are positioned like the picture above.</strong>
<p>
Begin by aligning the top two videos of Daniel Hudson.
Video alignment can be done automatically using a technique called coincident points:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Press the comma key to enter coincident pointing mode. The border of the canvas should be blue.
</li>
<li>
In the first video (top left), click on Daniel Hudson’s glove to place your first point.
</li>
<li>
In the same video, click on the back of his shoe to place your second point.
</li>
<li>
Go to the second video and place two more points on his glove and shoe in the same order.
</li>
<li>
Once the fourth point is placed, the first video will snap to align with the second video.
</li>
<li>
Press the comma key again. The blue border should disappear.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Drag one of the Daniel Hudson videos on top of the other to create an overlay.
Do this again with the other two Lance Lynn videos.
Your layout will look messy now, so you can delete the original videos by selecting them and pressing Delete.
Delete the non-overlays. You won't need them anymore.
</p>

<p>
Each overlay comes with three timelines: two for each individual video, and the third which controls both.
Try scrubbing through the bottom timeline of each overlay.
</p>
<p>
Now, scrub through each overlay until you reach the point where the pitcher releases the ball.
Once you are happy with how they look, play through each overlay independently and compare.
</p>
<strong class="small-centered">Answer the following questions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Who has a more consistent pitch?</li>
<li>Who has a larger break in their pitch?</li>
<li>Was the coincident point alignment helpful in in your comparison?</li>
<li>Do you think the coincident points made alignment easier? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What did you like or dislike about comparing with overlays?</li>
</ul>
